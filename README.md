# Isabella's Portfolio

Hope you are having a great day, this is my portfolio.

I did it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## Optimized:
I was part of an Inco Academy course called "Green Digital Skills" in which we learn how to design webs that are enviromentally friendly.
So, in the 1.0.7 update, I've compressed the images and got rid of the custom fonts to improve loading times and CO2 emissions everytime someone visits the website.

CO2 emissions on first visit before ( 1.0.6 version ):
0.481g

CO2 emissions on first visit now ( 1.0.8 version ):
0.029g

I used https://digitalbeacon.co/ to get this information.

## Deploy:

Although there's a GitHub Page avalaible, the best way to check the website is with the Netlify Deploy which you can access at the "About" section of this repository.
